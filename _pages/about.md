Hello World!
I am Fenil Bardoliya. I am a graduate student at Arizona State University, completing my Master of Science in Computer Science. Currently, I work at [Complex Data Reasoning and Analysis Lab (CoRAL)](https://coral-lab-asu.github.io/), where I am advised by [Dr. Vivek Gupta](https://vgupta123.github.io/). Previously, I was a Computer Vision Research Aide at [DREAMS LAB](https://dreams-lab.replit.app/). Before joining ASU, I interned at Samsung Semiconductor India Research. I completed my Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Science from Birla Institute of Technology and Science Pilani (BITS Pilani).

Apart from academics, I'm keenly observant, and I love traveling. I also like Swimming, Basketball, Tennis and playing Dota 2.
