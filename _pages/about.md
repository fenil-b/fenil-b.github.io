Hello World!
I am Fenil Bardoliya. I am a graduate student at Arizona State University, completing my Master of Science in Computer Science. I am also a Computer Vision Research Aide at [DREAMS LAB](https://dreams-lab.replit.app/). My research interest lies at an intersection of Computer Vision and Deep Learning. Before joining ASU, I interned at Samsung Semiconductor India Research. I completed my Bachelor of Engineer in Computer Science from Birla Institute of Technology and Science Pilani (BITS Pilani).
